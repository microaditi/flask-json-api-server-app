## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- (Optional) Docker installed and running

### Installation (Without Docker)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-docker-app.git
   cd flask-docker-app
````

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

### Docker Usage

If you want to run this app using Docker, you'll need a `Dockerfile`. Once you have that, you can build and run the container like this:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t flask-docker-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-docker-app
```

## Example Response

```json
GET /

{
  "message": "Welcome to the Dockerized Flask app!"
}
```

Do you want me to generate the `requirements.txt` file for this setup too?
